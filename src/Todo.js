        To Do was my first significant project in a computer science class,
        which I completed at the end of taking Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50. It is
        a full-stack to-do-list app that was created with a Python and SQL
        back-end and an HTML, CSS, and Javascript front-end. I also used the
        Flask framework. Users can create, and delete tasks and label them as
        today, tomorrow, and long term, as well as priority one, priority two,
        and priority three. The tasks are automatically sorted and color-coded
        according to these timelines and priorities. You can create, update, and
        delete tasks, and you can also view your deleted tasks on the history
        tab. Check out the app in the video below, or check out the Github
        repository <GitLink href="www.github.com">here.</GitLink>{" "}
